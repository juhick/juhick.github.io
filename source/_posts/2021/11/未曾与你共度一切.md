**现在我要告诉你一些事情。**

Now let me tell you something.



**我看过无数次日出日落，在大地上，森林和群山都被笼罩在光芒之中，**

I have seen a thousand sunsets and sunrises, on land where it floods forest and mountains with honey coloured light,



**在大海上，为五彩的云朵增添上一抹血橘色，在无垠的大海上划进划出。**

at sea where it rises and sets like a blood orange in a multicoloured nest of cloud, slipping in and out of the vast ocean.



**我看过无数次月亮：满月如金币，寒月洁白似冰屑，新月宛如小天鹅的羽毛。**

I have seen a thousand moons: harvest moons like gold coins, winter moons as white as ice chips, new moons like baby swans' feathers.



**我看过大海平静如止，颜色如缎，或蓝如翠鸟，或如玻璃般透明，抑或如乌黑褶皱的泡沫，沉重而危险的翻动着。**

I have seen seas as smooth as if painted, coloured like shot silk or blue as a kingfisher or transparent as glass or black and crumpled with foam, moving ponderously and murderously.



**我感受过来自南极的烈风，寒冷呼啸着像一个走失的儿童；感受过如爱人呼吸般的柔风；掺杂着苦涩的咸味和海草死亡气息的海风；弥散着森林大地肥沃土壤气息和千万种花香的山风。**

I have felt winds straight from the South Pole, bleak and wailing like a lost child; winds that carried the astringent smell of salt and the death of seaweeds; winds that carried the moist rich smell of a forest floor, the smell of a million flowers.



**狂风涛海如同酵母发酵起沫，或使海水轻拍海岸像小猫一般。**

Fierce winds that churned and moved the sea like yeast, or winds that made the waters lap at the shore like a kitten.



**我了解宁静：一口新井中寒冷又朴实的宁静；一个深洞中无情冷酷的宁静；炎热迷离的午后万物被炎炎烈日催眠的宁静；一曲美妙音乐结束的宁静。**

I have known silence: the cold, earthy silence at the bottom of a newly dug well; the implacable stony silence of a deep cave; the hot, drugged midday silence when everything is hypnotised and stilled into silence by the eye of the sun; the silence when great music ends.



**我听过夏日蝉鸣如芒在骨,**

I have heard summer cicadas cry so that the sound seems stitched into your bones,



**我听过树蛙，在无数萤火虫点亮的森林中，演奏着如巴赫管弦乐般美妙复杂的旋律。**

I have heard tree frogs in an orchestration as complicated as Bach singing in a forest lit by a million emerald fireflies.



**我听过啄羊鹦鹉飞跃冰川叫喊着，像老人呻吟着走向大海。**

I have heard the Keas calling over grey glaciers that groaned to themselves like old people as they inched their way to the sea.



**我听过声嘶力竭的街道商贩成交皮草生意的叫嚷，好像是对他们鎏金妻子的赞美；**

I have heard the hoarse street vendor cries of the mating Fur seals as they sang to their sleek golden wives,



**响尾蛇清脆却不连贯的警告声；成群结队的蝙蝠的刺耳叫声；马鹿在齐膝的紫石楠中的咆哮。**

the crisp staccato admonishment of the Rattlesnake, the cobweb squeak of the Bat and the belling roar of the Red deer knee-deep in purple heather.



**我听过狼群在冬夜对月长嚎，红吼候啸震山林。**

I have heard Wolves baying at a winter's moon, Red howlers making the forest vibrate with their roaring cries.



**我听过珊瑚群中异彩斑斓的鱼群发出的吱吱、呱呱和呢喃。**

I have heard the squeak, purr and grunt of a hundred multi-coloured reef fishes.



**我见过蜂鸟如同宝石一般围绕着开红花的树闪烁，如陀螺一般哼鸣作响。**

I have seen hummingbirds flashing like opals round a tree of scarlet blooms, humming like a top.



**我见过飞鱼如水银一般穿越蓝色海浪，用他们的尾翼在海面上划下银色痕迹。**

I have seen flying fish, skittering like quicksilver across the blue waves, drawing silver lines on the surface with their tails.



**我见过琵鹭像朱红的旗帜从鸟巢飞往鸟群。**

I have seen Spoonbills flying home to roost like a scarlet banner across the sky.



**我见过漆黑洳焦的鲸鱼，在如矢车菊般的蓝色海洋中停留，呼吸间创造了一个凡尔赛宫的喷泉。**

I have seen Whales, black as tar, cushioned on a cornflower blue sea, creating a Versailles of fountain with their breath.



**我见过阳光熨展蝴蝶的翅膀，它浮现、停顿、又扇动。**

I have watched butterflies emerge and sit, trembling, while the sun irons their wings smooth.



**我见过鲜如火焰的老虎在长草之中亲昵。**

I have watched Tigers, like flames, mating in the long grass.



**我曾被愤怒的乌鸦俯冲攻击，如魔鬼的爪牙黑暗顺滑。**

I have been dive-bombed by an angry Raven, black and glossy as the Devil's hoof.



**我曾躺在温暖如牛奶、柔顺如丝绸的水中，任一群海豚在我身边嬉戏。**

I have lain in water warm as milk, soft as silk, while around me played a host of Dolphins.



**我曾遇到过无数生灵，曾看过无数美景……**

I have met a thousand animals and seen a thousand wonderful things …



**这一切却未与你共度。**

All this I did without you.



**这都是我的损失。**

This was my loss.



**这些事情我都想与你共度。**

All this I want to do with you.



**这一切才会是我的收获。**

This will be my gain.



**为了有你一分钟的陪伴，我愿放弃这一切，为你的笑声，你的声音，你的眼睛，头发，嘴唇，身体，**

All this I would gladly have forgone for the sake of one minute of your company, for your laugh, your voice, your eyes, hair, lips, body,



**尤其是你善良又令人惊喜的心，那是只有我有权利开发的宝藏。**

and above all for your sweet, ever surprising mind which is an enchanting quarry in which it is my privilege to delve.
